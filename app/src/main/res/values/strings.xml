        <item>“Say You Won’t Let Go” is the first single from British singer-songwriter James Arthur’s second studio album, Back from the Edge. The song has peaked at No. 1 in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and Sweden.\n\nThe song’s tender lyrics talk about falling in love with someone at first sight, and wanting to grow old with them. He talks about enjoying and loving her when she is young, and still wanting to be with her when she is old and grey, just as long as she “won’t let go.”\n\nTo show how serious he is about his love for her, he even expresses the desire to be with her after they both die.\n\nJames Arthur recently explained that a lot of the song came from imagination. “I wanted to write the type of song that guys would want to play for their girlfriends.”\n\nArthur said of this:\n\n[It’s] about looking at the future and spending your life with someone, even after death.</item>
        <item>“Kill Bill” is the second track on SZA’s sophomore album SOS. The title references the iconic Kill Bill film duology directed by Quentin Tarantino.

        <item>“A&amp;W” is a 7-minute rant track that splits into two sections with Lana narrating an anecdote that begins in her innocent childhood and climbs through her adulthood, where she becomes a sex addict, considering the track’s title is an abbreviation for “American Whore.” The single marks her second unanticipated single, which placed its spot on her ninth studio album.\n\nOn December 7, 2022, the single announcement was first declared via Jack Antonoff on an Instagram post, which followed onwards from unveiling Lana’s December 2022 track “Did you know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd.” In the Instagram post, Antonoff claimed that this single was his favorite project:\n\ndid you know that there’s a tunnel under ocean blvd\n\n! march 10th 2023 !!\n\ncan’t wait for everyone to hear this album – ‘american whore’ is my favorite we’ve ever done.\n\nThe track’s title was found online on a retailer’s website, which depicted the album’s vinyl. On January 13, 2023, the title was later affirmed when Lana Del Rey proclaimed the Did you know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd’s tracklist.\n\nOn February 7, 2023, the song began being displayed on Apple Music, suggesting its upcoming release. On Valentine’s Day, an hour prior to its release, Del Rey’s manager Ben Mawson confirmed the release of the track.</item>

        <item>Revered as an essential rock song of the 2000s, “Viva La Vida” tells the story of a monarch who’s lost his kingdom. In another aspect, the song is also seen as a narrative on the French Revolution given the historical and biblical references in the lyrics. The instrumental is based around a string and piano background, led by an orchestral drum beat.\n\nThe title derives from the Spanish phrase “Long Live Life,” and takes its name from Frida Kahlo’s last painting before her death. During a March 2008 interview with Rolling Stone, frontman Chris Martin explained the reason for naming the song and album in honour of Kahlo:\n\nShe went through a lot of shit, of course, and then she started a big painting in her house that said ‘Viva la Vida.’ I just loved the boldness of it.\n\nThis song debuted to massive success and acclaim, peaking at number one on both the Billboard 100 and UK Singles Chart. Coldplay received several awards for the track, including Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards in February 2009.\n\nThe chorus has musical similarities to Joe Satriani’s instrumental piece, “If I Could Fly.” Satriani sued Coldplay for plagiarism—they settled out of court. The band Creaky Boards also accused Coldplay of taking the song’s melody from their record, “The Songs I Didn’t Write,” however, Coldplay denied the allegations.\n\nColdplay released two music videos for this song. Hype Williams made the official video, which premiered in August 2008, depicting the band against a backdrop of Eugène Delacroix’s painting, Liberty Leading the People. The alternate music video dropped alongside the first one but was directed by Anton Corbijn and starred Chris Martin as a king.</item>
        <item>Six years after the song’s official release, The Weeknd reunites with the multi-talented Ariana Grande for the official remix of Abel’s 2016 hit “Die for You.” The two had previously collaborated on the “Save Your Tears” remix in 2021, as well as Ariana’s “off the table” in 2020 and “Love Me Harder” in 2014.\n\nThanks to TikTok, the original song saw a surge in popularity in early 2023, reaching a new peak on the Billboard Top 100 at #6. This led Ariana to share part of her verse on social media, hinting at a possible collaboration between the two artists. One day later, on February 22, both artists announced their shared remix to the public.</item>
        <item>“死ぬのがいいわ (Shinunoga E-wa)“ is an exquisitely interesting and unique song via a combination of Showa (old Japanese era) style lyrics /melody and the modern trap-style beat. The song has been arguably the singer-songwriter’s most successful track on his personal record so far in 2022.\n\nIn mid 2022, “Shinunoga E-wa” off Fujii Kaze’s debut album Help Ever Hurt Never caught the world by surprise. This two-year-old song first started to explode in Thailand in late July 2022 after many TikTok users featured it in their videos on the app. Its success continues to escalate globally over the months, enabling Fujii Kaze to attend the 73rd installment of the famous Japanese New Year’s Eve TV event, Kohaku Uta Gassen.\n\nAs this song has gone viral, Kaze released “Shinunoga E-wa” Live at Nippon Budokan version on his YouTube. On Billboard Japan Hot Albums chart, his debut album returned at No.95 on August 17, 2022, previously reaching No.1 on June 1, 2020.</item>
